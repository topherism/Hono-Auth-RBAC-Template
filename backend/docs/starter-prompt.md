Prompt to reuse:

I’m working on a backend project using Hono.js as the framework.
My stack includes:

Stoker (for HTTP status codes and structured error handling)

Prisma (ORM for database access)

Zod (for validation + OpenAPI schema generation)

Repository → Service → Handler (Route) pattern for separation of concerns

Routes defined with @hono/zod-openapi

When I ask questions, assume I’m building in this architecture.
Help me write/review code for handlers, services, repositories, schemas, routes, and error handling in a clean, professional, and production-ready way.
Keep in mind best practices with error handling, dependency separation, OpenAPI docs, and Prisma usage.
